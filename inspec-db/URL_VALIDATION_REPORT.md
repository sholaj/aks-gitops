## Current Package Versions (Jan 2025)

| Component | Old Version | New Version | Status |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| FreeTDS | 1.3.3-1.el8 | **1.4.23-1.el8** | ✅ Updated |
| Ansible | 8.3.0-1.el8 | **9.2.0-1.el8** | ✅ Updated |

| Oracle Client | 21.13.0.0.0-1 | 21.13.0.0.0-1 | ✅ Current |

## Mirror Status

| Mirror | Status | Speed | Reliability |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Microsoft packages.microsoft.com | ✅ Working | Fast | Excellent |
| Oracle download.oracle.com | ✅ Working | Good | Excellent |
| EPEL dl.fedoraproject.org | ✅ Working | Fast | Excellent |
| Rocky dl.rockylinux.org | ✅ Working | Fast | Excellent |
| CentOS mirror.centos.org | ❌ 404 Errors | N/A | Deprecated |

## Recommendations

1. **Use the updated scripts** - All URLs are now current and tested
2. **Monitor package versions** - Check monthly for updates
3. **Use Rocky Linux mirrors** - More reliable than CentOS for RHEL 8 packages
4. **Test before deployment** - Run `./test-download-urls.sh` periodically

## Quick Fix Applied

The main download scripts (`download-binaries.sh` and `download-ansible-binary.sh`) have been automatically updated with the current working URLs. No manual intervention needed - just run the scripts as normal.
