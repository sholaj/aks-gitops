We have successfully implemented the initial version of the NIST compliance checks for MSSQL databases using InSpec. However, there are some gaps in the current implementation that need to be addressed to fully align with the original NIST_for_db.ksh and NIST.ksh scripts' functionality.

Files to review:
- NIST_for_db.ksh
- NIST.ksh
- MULTI_PLATFORM_IMPLEMENTATION.md

Always quote template expression brackets when they start a value. For instance:\n\n    with_items:\n      - {{ foo }}\n\nShould be written as:\n\n    with_items:\n      - \"{{ foo }}\"\n"}

GDCTWVC0007_1733            : ok=14   changed=2   unreachable=0   failed=1   skipped=6   rescued=0   ignored=0

To address these gaps, we need to:
- correct the regex_search line inside process_results.yml so it parses JSON cleanly?
