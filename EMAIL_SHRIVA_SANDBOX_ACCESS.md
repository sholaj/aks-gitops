# Email to Shriva - Sandbox Database Access Request

**To:** Shriva
**Subject:** Request: Sandbox Database Access for NIST Compliance Testing

Hi Shriva,

We're implementing automated NIST compliance scanning for Oracle and Sybase databases using Ansible and InSpec (similar to our MSSQL implementation).

**Request:**
- Access to sandbox Oracle database (12c/19c)
- Access to sandbox Sybase ASE database (15/16)
- Read-only APMD service account with necessary permissions for compliance scans

**Purpose:** Testing and validation before production deployment.

**Timeline:** Need access by [DATE] to stay on schedule.

Please let me know if you need additional details.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
