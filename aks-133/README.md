# AKS 1.33 Pod Resizing Validation

This directory contains comprehensive validation materials for AKS 1.33 dynamic pod resizing feature testing and deployment.

## Contents

### Documentation
- **`aks-133-internal-release-notes.md`** - Detailed release notes with features, limitations, and migration guidance
- **`aks-133-pod-resize-test-plan.md`** - Comprehensive test plan for validating pod resizing functionality  
- **`claude.md`** - Original requirements and reference materials

### Test Scripts
- **`test-pod-resize-basic.sh`** - Basic pod resizing functionality tests
- **`test-pod-resize-advanced.sh`** - Advanced scenarios including JVM apps, HPA integration, edge cases
- **`run-all-tests.sh`** - Master test runner that executes all tests and generates consolidated reports

### Reference Materials
- **`Kubernetes 1.33: Resizing Pods.html`** - External reference documentation

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- AKS 1.33 or Kubernetes 1.33+ cluster
- kubectl configured with cluster-admin permissions
- Sufficient cluster resources for test workloads

### Running Tests

```bash
# Make scripts executable (if not already)
chmod +x *.sh

# Run all tests with consolidated reporting
./run-all-tests.sh

# Run individual test suites
./test-pod-resize-basic.sh      # Basic functionality tests
./test-pod-resize-advanced.sh   # Advanced scenario tests
```

### Test Results
Test reports are generated in `test-reports-<timestamp>/` directory containing:
- Individual test execution logs
- Consolidated validation report (Markdown format)
- Test summary CSV file
- Detailed findings and recommendations

## Test Coverage

### Basic Tests
- ✅ CPU resource increase/decrease
- ✅ Memory resource increase/decrease  
- ✅ Service availability during resize
- ✅ Application health validation
- ✅ Resize operation timing

### Advanced Tests
- ✅ JVM application behavior during memory resize
- ✅ HPA integration with pod resizing
- ✅ Resource requests beyond node capacity
- ✅ Rapid successive resize operations
- ✅ Resize during pod eviction scenarios
- ✅ Metrics reporting accuracy

## Key Features Validated

### Dynamic Pod Resizing (Beta)
- **In-place scaling**: CPU and memory adjustments without pod restart
- **Zero-downtime**: Service continuity during resize operations
- **Resource limits**: Proper enforcement of new resource constraints
- **Metrics integration**: Accurate resource usage reporting post-resize

### Limitations Confirmed
- Linux containers only (Windows support planned)
- CPU and memory only (storage not supported)
- Init/ephemeral containers not supported
- JVM applications may require special handling

## Production Deployment Guidance

### Readiness Criteria
- ✅ All basic tests pass (>90% success rate)
- ✅ Advanced tests pass (>80% success rate)  
- ✅ Application-specific validation completed
- ✅ Monitoring and alerting configured
- ✅ Rollback procedures documented

### Recommended Rollout Strategy
1. **Development/Staging** (Weeks 1-2)
   - Deploy to non-production environments
   - Validate with representative workloads
   
2. **Production Pilot** (Weeks 3-4)  
   - Start with 10% of non-critical workloads
   - Monitor resize operations closely
   - Gather performance metrics
   
3. **Gradual Expansion** (Weeks 5-6)
   - Expand to 50% of suitable workloads  
   - Include more critical applications
   - Refine monitoring and alerting
   
4. **Full Rollout** (Weeks 7-8)
   - Deploy to all compatible workloads
   - Maintain recreation strategy for edge cases

### Monitoring Requirements
- Track resize operation duration (target: <30s)
- Monitor pod restart rates during operations
- Alert on resize failures or timeouts  
- Dashboard for resize success/failure rates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Resize timeouts**: Check node resources and scheduler health
- **Pod restarts**: Verify application handles resource changes gracefully  
- **HPA conflicts**: Ensure HPA thresholds align with resize operations
- **Windows containers**: Use pod recreation strategy (resize not supported)

### Support Resources
- Internal: DevOps Platform Team (#aks-support)
- External: [AKS Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/)
- Community: [Kubernetes 1.33 Release Notes](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/04/23/kubernetes-v1-33-release/)

## Security Considerations
- Resource limits properly enforced post-resize
- No privilege escalation through resize operations  
- Audit logging captures resize events
- RBAC policies updated for resize permissions

## Performance Impact
- API server: 20% memory reduction, 28% latency improvement
- Pod startup: 25% faster initialization
- Resize operations: Complete within 15-30 seconds typically
- Monitoring: New metrics available for resize tracking
