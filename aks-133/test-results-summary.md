# Pod Resize Test Results Summary

## Test Environment
- **Kubernetes Version**: v1.33.0 (kind cluster)
- **kubectl Version**: v1.34.0
- **Test Date**: 2025-09-15
- **Provider**: kind (Kubernetes in Docker)

## Test Results

### Overall Summary
âœ… **ALL TESTS PASSED (18/18 - 100% Success Rate)**

### Tests Executed

1. **CPU Resize Test** âœ…
   - Successfully resized CPU from 100m â†’ 250m
   - No pod restarts during resize
   - Pod maintained same identity (UID unchanged)

2. **Memory Resize Test** âœ…
   - Successfully resized memory from 64Mi â†’ 256Mi
   - No pod restarts during resize
   - Container maintained same ID

3. **Combined CPU+Memory Resize** âœ…
   - Successfully resized both CPU and memory simultaneously
   - CPU: 250m â†’ 300m
   - Memory: 256Mi â†’ 384Mi
   - No pod restarts during combined resize

4. **Resize Validation Test** âœ…
   - Direct pod patch (without --subresource) correctly rejected
   - Invalid resize attempts properly blocked

5. **Allocated Resources Check** âœ…
   - Resource allocation properly tracked
   - Final state verified successfully

## Key Findings

### âœ… Working Features
- In-place pod resizing using `--subresource resize` flag
- CPU resize without pod restart
- Memory resize without pod restart
- Combined resource resize
- ResizePolicy properly enforced
- Resource validation working correctly

### ðŸ“‹ Requirements Confirmed
- âœ… Kubernetes 1.33+ cluster
- âœ… kubectl v1.34+ client (for --subresource resize)
- âœ… ResizePolicy configured in pod spec
- âœ… Linux nodes (tested on kind)
- âœ… Feature gates enabled (InPlacePodVerticalScaling)

## Scripts Created

1. **test-pod-resize-improved.sh**
   - Enhanced error handling
   - Retry mechanisms
   - Debug mode
   - Flexible configuration
   - Comprehensive reporting

2. **setup-local-k8s.sh**
   - Auto-detects Kubernetes providers
   - Installs missing components
   - Configures feature gates
   - Supports kind, minikube, Docker Desktop

3. **simple-resize-test.sh**
   - Quick validation script
   - Minimal dependencies
   - Clear success/failure indicators

## Conclusion

Pod resizing is fully functional in Kubernetes v1.33 with the following conditions:
- The `--subresource resize` flag must be used with kubectl
- ResizePolicy must be defined in the pod spec
- The feature works without pod restarts as intended
- Both CPU and memory can be resized independently or together

The feature provides significant operational benefits by allowing resource adjustments without service disruption.
