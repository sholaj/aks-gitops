# Pre-Production Validation Checklist for VPA-NAP Integration

## Overview

This comprehensive checklist ensures the VPA-NAP integration system is thoroughly validated and ready for production deployment. All items must be completed and verified before any production rollout.

**Target Timeline**: 8-12 weeks of comprehensive testing  
**Required Sign-offs**: DevOps Lead, SRE Team, Security Team, Platform Engineering Manager

## Phase 1: Component Validation ✅

### Foundation Components

#### VPA-NAP Coordinator

- [ ] Log levels and formatting are appropriate for production monitoring

#### Kyverno Policy Engine
- [ ] All Kyverno policies validate without syntax errors
- [ ] Policy mutation logic works as expected for different tenant tiers
- [ ] Policy violation scenarios properly reject invalid configurations
- [ ] Policy performance impact is within acceptable limits (<100ms per resource)
- [ ] Policy dependencies and ordering are correct

#### RBAC and Security
- [ ] Service accounts have minimal required permissions
- [ ] ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings follow least-privilege principle
- [ ] Network policies restrict communication appropriately
- [ ] Pod security standards are enforced
- [ ] Secrets and ConfigMaps are properly secured

### Configuration Validation

#### Tenant Tier Configurations
- [ ] **Dev Tier**: Auto mode VPA with maxCPU=2, maxMemory=4Gi applies correctly
- [ ] **Standard Tier**: Initial mode VPA with maxCPU=8, maxMemory=16Gi applies correctly
- [ ] **Premium Tier**: Off mode VPA with maxCPU=32, maxMemory=64Gi applies correctly
- [ ] Tenant isolation boundaries are respected
- [ ] Resource quota enforcement works with VPA recommendations

#### Circuit Breaker Validation
- [ ] Node change threshold (>5 in 5min) triggers circuit breaker
- [ ] Pod eviction threshold (>20 in 10min) triggers circuit breaker
- [ ] Resource oscillation detection (>30% variance) works correctly
- [ ] Circuit breaker cooldown periods are respected
- [ ] Manual circuit breaker override procedures work

## Phase 2: Integration Testing ✅

### End-to-End Workflow Validation

#### VPA Lifecycle Management

### Performance and Scale Testing

#### Load Testing Results
- [ ] **VPA Creation**: System handles 100+ VPAs without performance degradation
- [ ] **Concurrent Operations**: Multiple tenants can create/modify VPAs simultaneously
- [ ] **Resource Usage**: Coordinator CPU <200m, Memory <256Mi under load
- [ ] **Response Times**: VPA coordination decisions complete within 500ms (95th percentile)
- [ ] **Throughput**: System processes 50+ VPA operations per minute

#### Scale Testing Results
- [ ] **Node Scaling**: System stable with NAP scaling to 50+ nodes
- [ ] **Tenant Scaling**: 100+ tenant namespaces with active VPAs
- [ ] **Workload Diversity**: Mixed CPU/memory intensive workloads handled correctly
- [ ] **Resource Efficiency**: VPA recommendations improve resource utilization by >15%

## Phase 3: Pre-Production Validation ✅

#### Resource Exhaustion Testing
- [ ] System degrades gracefully under memory pressure
- [ ] Circuit breaker activates during resource exhaustion
- [ ] Essential operations continue during resource constraints
- [ ] Recovery occurs automatically when resources become available
- [ ] Monitoring captures resource exhaustion events

### Security Validation

#### Vulnerability Assessment
- [ ] **Container Images**: All images scanned with zero critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Dependency Scanning**: No high-severity dependencies in use
- [ ] **Configuration Security**: All configuration follows security hardening guidelines
- [ ] **Network Security**: Network policies properly isolate components

#### Compliance Verification
- [ ] **Pod Security Standards**: All pods comply with restricted security standards
- [ ] **Data Protection**: No sensitive data in logs or configuration
- [ ] **Audit Logging**: All privileged operations are properly audited
