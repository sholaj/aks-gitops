## Issue Summary
**Title:** Implement Comprehensive Monitoring and Alerting for VPA-NAP Integration

**Type:** Story  
**Priority:** High  
**Labels:** `monitoring`, `alerting`, `observability`, `vpa-nap`, `high-priority`  
**Milestone:** Production Ready v1.0  
**Estimated Effort:** 32 hours  
**Assignee:** SRE Team Lead  

## Description
Establish comprehensive monitoring, alerting, and observability for the VPA-NAP integration system to ensure proactive issue detection, performance optimization, and system reliability in production.

## Background
Production deployment requires robust monitoring to track system health, performance metrics, and potential conflicts between VPA and NAP operations. We need to implement monitoring that provides visibility into both individual component performance and overall system behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] VPA-specific metrics collection implemented
- [ ] NAP scaling event monitoring configured
- [ ] Conflict detection alerting established
- [ ] Performance metrics dashboard created
- [ ] SLI/SLO definitions implemented
- [ ] Alert routing and escalation configured
- [ ] Log aggregation and analysis setup
- [ ] Distributed tracing for request flows
- [ ] Custom metrics for business logic
- [ ] Integration with existing monitoring stack

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All critical metrics are monitored with appropriate thresholds
- [ ] Alert fatigue is minimized through proper tuning
- [ ] Dashboards provide actionable insights
- [ ] On-call procedures include VPA-NAP specific runbooks
- [ ] Monitoring data retention policies configured
- [ ] Team trained on new monitoring capabilities
- [ ] Performance baselines established
- [ ] Automated anomaly detection configured

## Technical Requirements
### Metrics Collection
- VPA recommendation accuracy and adoption rates
- NAP scaling decisions and node utilization
- Conflict detection and resolution metrics
- Resource utilization trends (CPU, memory, storage)
- API response times and error rates
- Pod scheduling and eviction events

### Alerting Strategy
- **Critical:** Service unavailability, security breaches
- **High:** Performance degradation, conflict escalation
- **Medium:** Resource threshold breaches, anomalies
- **Low:** Informational events, trends

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Alert testing in staging environment
- [ ] Dashboard functionality validation
- [ ] Metric accuracy verification
- [ ] False positive rate assessment
- [ ] Alert response time measurement

## Dependencies
- Azure Monitor/Prometheus setup
- Grafana dashboard infrastructure
- PagerDuty/AlertManager configuration
- Log aggregation system (ELK/Azure Log Analytics)
- Issue #01: Production Deployment

## Risk Assessment
**Medium Risk Factors:**
- Alert fatigue from poorly tuned thresholds
- Performance impact of extensive monitoring
- Data retention and storage costs

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Gradual rollout with threshold tuning
- Sampling strategies for high-volume metrics
- Automated alert tuning based on historical data
- Cost monitoring and optimization
