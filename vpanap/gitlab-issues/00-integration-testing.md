3. **Test Reports**: Detailed results and analysis
4. **Performance Benchmarks**: Baseline metrics for production
5. **Issue Log**: Identified issues with resolution status
6. **Documentation**: Test procedures and troubleshooting guides
7. **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing in deployment pipeline

## Next Steps After Completion
1. **Security Sign-off**: Obtain security team approval based on test results
2. **Performance Review**: Validate performance meets production requirements
3. **Production Planning**: Create detailed production deployment strategy
4. **Team Training**: Ensure operations team is prepared for production

## Notes
- This is a **blocking epic** - production deployment cannot proceed without successful completion
- All test scenarios must be validated in production-like environments
- Performance benchmarks established here will be used for production monitoring
- Security findings must be resolved before production deployment
- Integration with existing monitoring and alerting systems is required
