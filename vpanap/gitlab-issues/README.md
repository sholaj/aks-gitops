## Using These Issues in GitLab

### Importing Issues

#### Method 1: Manual Creation
1. Create a new issue in GitLab
2. Copy the content from each markdown file
3. Set appropriate labels and milestones
4. Assign team members

#### Method 2: GitLab API Import
```bash
# Example script to import issues using GitLab API
PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
GITLAB_TOKEN="your-access-token"

for file in *.md; do
  if [[ "$file" != "README.md" && "$file" != "issues-summary.md" ]]; then
    TITLE=$(grep "^**Title:**" "$file" | cut -d':' -f2- | xargs)
    DESCRIPTION=$(cat "$file")
    
    curl --request POST \
      --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: $GITLAB_TOKEN" \
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --data "{
        \"title\": \"$TITLE\",
        \"description\": \"$DESCRIPTION\",
        \"labels\": \"vpa-nap,follow-up\"
      }" \
      "https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/$PROJECT_ID/issues"
  fi
done
```

#### Method 3: GitLab Import via CSV
Convert issues to CSV format and use GitLab's CSV import feature.

### Setting Up Issue Board

Create a GitLab issue board with these columns:
1. **Backlog** - All new issues
2. **Ready** - Dependencies met, ready to start
3. **In Progress** - Active work
4. **Review** - Pending review/testing
5. **Done** - Completed

### Recommended Labels

Apply these labels to organize issues:
- `vpa-nap` - All VPA-NAP related issues
- `critical` / `high` / `medium` - Priority levels
- `deployment` / `monitoring` / `security` / `performance` - Categories
- `blocked` - Waiting for dependencies
- `ready-for-work` - Can be started immediately

## Execution Timeline
