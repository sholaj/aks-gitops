# Production Deployment and Rollout

## Issue Summary
**Title:** Implement Production Deployment Pipeline for VPA-NAP Integration

**Type:** Epic  
**Priority:** High  
**Labels:** `deployment`, `production`, `vpa-nap`, `epic`, `high-priority`  
**Milestone:** Production Ready v1.0  
**Estimated Effort:** 40 hours  
**Assignee:** DevOps Team Lead  

## Description
Implement a comprehensive production deployment pipeline for the VPA-NAP integration system, including blue-green deployment strategy, automated rollback mechanisms, and progressive rollout capabilities.

## Background
The VPA-NAP integration has been successfully developed and tested in staging environments. We need to establish a robust production deployment pipeline that ensures zero-downtime deployments, maintains system stability, and provides quick rollback capabilities in case of issues.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Blue-green deployment pipeline implemented using GitOps
- [ ] Automated health checks and validation gates configured
- [ ] Progressive rollout strategy (canary deployment) established
- [ ] Automated rollback triggers based on SLI/SLO violations
- [ ] Production environment provisioning automated
- [ ] Database migration pipeline integrated
- [ ] Configuration management for production secrets
- [ ] Deployment monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Pre-deployment validation tests automated
- [ ] Post-deployment verification scripts implemented

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Production deployment pipeline is fully automated
- [ ] Zero-downtime deployment capability validated
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested and documented
- [ ] All deployment stages have proper approval gates
- [ ] Deployment metrics and logging are captured
- [ ] Team can deploy to production with confidence
- [ ] Disaster recovery procedures are tested
- [ ] Documentation updated and team trained

## Technical Requirements
### Infrastructure
- Production AKS cluster with multiple node pools
- Azure DevOps or GitLab CI/CD pipeline
- Azure Key Vault for secrets management
- Azure Monitor for deployment tracking
- Load balancer configuration for blue-green switching

### Deployment Strategy
- Blue-green deployment with traffic switching
- Canary releases with 5%, 25%, 50%, 100% traffic splits
- Automated health checks at each stage
- SLI/SLO monitoring for deployment validation

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] End-to-end deployment testing in staging
- [ ] Rollback scenario testing
- [ ] Performance impact assessment during deployment
- [ ] Security validation post-deployment
- [ ] Multi-tenant functionality verification

## Dependencies
- Issue #02: Monitoring and Alerting Setup
- Issue #04: Security Hardening Validation
- Production AKS cluster availability
- Network and firewall configurations
- SSL certificate management

## Risk Assessment
**High Risk Factors:**
- Production data integrity during deployment
- Service availability during traffic switching
- Rollback complexity with stateful components

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Comprehensive backup strategy before deployment
- Database migration testing in staging
- Progressive rollout with quick rollback capability
- Real-time monitoring and alerting

## Tasks Breakdown
1. **Pipeline Setup** (8h)
   - Configure GitOps workflow
   - Set up blue-green infrastructure
   - Implement approval gates

2. **Health Checks** (6h)
   - Create deployment validation scripts
   - Configure monitoring integration
   - Set up automated rollback triggers

3. **Canary Deployment** (10h)
   - Implement traffic splitting logic
   - Configure progressive rollout stages
   - Set up automated promotion criteria

4. **Security Integration** (8h)
   - Integrate security scanning in pipeline
   - Configure secrets management
   - Implement compliance validation

5. **Testing & Validation** (8h)
   - End-to-end deployment testing
   - Rollback scenario validation
   - Performance impact assessment

## Success Metrics
- Deployment success rate > 99%
- Mean time to deployment < 30 minutes
- Zero production incidents during deployment
- Rollback time < 5 minutes when needed
- Team confidence score > 4.5/5

## Notes
- Consider using Argo CD for GitOps implementation
- Integrate with existing Azure DevOps processes
- Ensure compliance with organization security policies
- Plan for multi-region deployment capability
