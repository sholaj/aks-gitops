**Title:** Implement Automated Tenant Onboarding Process for VPA-NAP Integration

**Type:** Feature  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Labels:** `onboarding`, `automation`, `multi-tenant`, `vpa-nap`, `medium-priority`  
**Milestone:** Production Ready v1.1  
**Estimated Effort:** 24 hours  
**Assignee:** Platform Engineering Team  

## Description
Develop a streamlined, automated tenant onboarding process that enables new tenants to quickly and safely adopt the VPA-NAP integration with proper isolation, resource allocation, and compliance controls.

## Background
As the VPA-NAP integration moves to production, we need to provide a seamless onboarding experience for new tenants while maintaining security, resource isolation, and operational efficiency. The onboarding process should be self-service where possible and include proper validation and approval workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Automated resource allocation and quota assignment
- [ ] Tenant-specific VPA and NAP policy generation
- [ ] Isolation validation and testing automated
- [ ] Approval workflow for tenant onboarding implemented
- [ ] Documentation and training materials created
- [ ] Billing and cost allocation integration
- [ ] Tenant health monitoring setup
- [ ] Offboarding process implemented
- [ ] Multi-environment tenant provisioning

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Tenant onboarding time reduced to < 2 hours
- [ ] Zero manual intervention required for standard onboarding
- [ ] All tenant isolation requirements validated
- [ ] Tenant satisfaction score > 4.0/5
- [ ] Onboarding documentation complete and accessible
- [ ] Support team trained on onboarding process
- [ ] Billing integration functional
- [ ] Compliance requirements met for all tenants
